# Just Another Text Editor

## Description

The J.A.T.E. application is a basic Text Editing application for personal or professional use. As someone who wants to write code on the go it was important that I could write offline. So I wrote an update to this code to add a service worker to cache and allow me to install and use the program offline with my code.
